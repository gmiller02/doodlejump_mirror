doodlejump README

Handin: this is my final handin

Overview:

My DoodleJump has the following classes: App, PaneOrganizer, DoodleJump, Doodle, and Platform. They are organized in the
following ways:

App instantiates my PaneOrganizer class.
PaneOrganizer creates an instance of my DoodleJump class and instantiates the various panes it uses.
DoodleJump contains an instance variable of my Doodle class and the EventHandlers that are necessary to animate my doodle.
Doodle contains an EventHandler of its own that allows the user to move it with different keys.
DoodleJump contains an instance of my Platform class called topPlatform, and several methods and an ArrayList that generate
an infinite amount of platform instances.

Design Choices:

I tried to separate my classes as much as possible so that I did not clutter my game class- for example, I put the keyHandler
that moves my doodle with arrow keys in my Doodle class. However, I do not think I use any logic that is out-of-ordinary because
I tried to follow the psuedocode as much as possible.

Known Bugs:

Hours: This project took around 20 hours to complete.
